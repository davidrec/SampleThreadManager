# SampleThreadManager
Sample project to demonstrate the work with Threads , Manager thread and Cancellation Token. 

Understanding this subject will help you write applications that perform multiple operations at the same time.
Applications that use multithreading are more responsive to user input because the user interface stays active as processor-intensive tasks execute on separate threads. 
Multithreading is also useful when you create scalable applications, because you can add threads as the workload increases.

A CancellationToken enables cooperative cancellation between threads, thread pool work items, or Task objects.
